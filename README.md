With the development of IoT(Internet of things), the application of IoT involves all aspects. The application of IoT in the fields of industry, agriculture, environment, transportation and other infrastructure effectively promotes the intelligent development of these aspects. It makes the allocation of limited resources more reasonable to improve the efficiency in the field. The application in home, health care, education and other areas closely related to life has greatly improved people's quality of life.

Our group is devoted to design a Greenhouse intelligent flower watering system based on Raspberry Pi. This system can real-time detect the environment parameters of Greenhouse and the humidity of soil. If the soil humidity is lower than threshold, Raspberry Pi will control water pipe watering the plants. When greenhouse temperature is abnormal, the buzzer will be activated. All the detecting(or detected) data will be sent to PC and be shown on a user Interface created by Qt.
